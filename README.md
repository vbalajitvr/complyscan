# infrarails

> Static compliance scanner for AWS AI infrastructure. Reads Terraform and reports which Article 9 (Bedrock Guardrails) and Article 12 (logging, retention, traceability) controls are passing, failing, or unverifiable — mapped to **EU AI Act**, **NIST AI RMF**, and **ISO/IEC 42001**.

## What is this?

`infrarails` is built for teams running **high-risk AI systems on AWS Bedrock**, and for teams voluntarily adopting Article 9 / Article 12-equivalent controls under **NIST AI RMF** or **ISO/IEC 42001**. It reads your **Terraform HCL** (and `.tf.json` files emitted by cdktf, Terragrunt, and similar generators) and reports exactly which infrastructure-layer controls are passing, failing, or cannot be verified statically — no deploy required.

Each finding is cross-referenced against:

- **EU AI Act** (Regulation 2024/1689) — Article 9 (risk management) and Article 12 (logging and traceability)
- **NIST AI RMF 1.0** — GOVERN / MEASURE / MANAGE / MAP functions
- **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** — Annex A controls (A.6.1.x, A.6.2.x)

The scanner is **deliberately conservative**: when it cannot prove a control is in place, it emits `INCONCLUSIVE` rather than `PASS` or `FAIL`. For a compliance tool, "we couldn't verify" is the only honest answer when evidence is split across stacks, modules, or runtime values.

> **Prerequisite, not a certificate.** A fully passing run is a **necessary but not sufficient** condition for EU AI Act / NIST AI RMF / ISO 42001 conformance. `infrarails` only verifies that a narrow set of AWS Bedrock infrastructure primitives are **declared** in your Terraform — it does not evaluate organisational, procedural, application-level, or runtime controls. See the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) for the full scope statement.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install hcl2json (one-time; see Prerequisites for Linux/Windows)
brew install hcl2json            # macOS

# 2. Install infrarails
npm install -g infrarails

# 3. Scan a Terraform directory
infrarails ./infra/

# 4. Generate a shareable report
infrarails ./infra/ --format pdf  -o report.pdf
infrarails ./infra/ --format html -o report.html
```

Runs natively on **macOS, Linux, and Windows** (PowerShell / `cmd.exe`). For audit-grade runs that resolve expressions and see inside remote modules, see [Audit-grade scan with `--plan`](#audit-grade-scan-with---plan).

---

## Rules

`infrarails` ships **10 rules** mapped to Articles 9 and 12. Each finding is one of: **PASS**, **FAIL**, **WARN**, **SKIP**, or **INCONCLUSIVE**.

| Rule ID | Severity | Article | Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| `S-9.x.1` | FAIL | 9 | Bedrock Agents must have a versioned guardrail attached (Agent-attached only — raw `InvokeModel`/`Converse` SDK calls are application-layer and out of scope for static IaC scanning) |
| `S-9.x.2` | WARN | 9 | When Bedrock is in use, at least one `aws_bedrock_guardrail` should be declared in the scanned Terraform |
| `S-12.1.1` | FAIL | 12 | `aws_bedrock_model_invocation_logging_configuration` is declared when Bedrock is in use |
| `S-12.1.2a` | WARN | 12 | CloudWatch log group has retention ≥ 180 days, or a forwarder is detected. Escalates to **FAIL** under `--strict-account-logging` when no subscription filter is found |
| `S-12.1.2b` | FAIL | 12 | S3 log bucket lifecycle ≥ 180 days (FAIL < 180; WARN 180–364; PASS ≥ 365) |
| `S-12.x.1` | FAIL | 12 | S3 log bucket has versioning (or object lock) enabled |
| `S-12.x.2a` | FAIL | 12 | S3 log bucket has KMS server-side encryption configured |
| `S-12.x.4` | FAIL | 12 | A CloudTrail trail is present and enabled |
| `S-12.x.5` | WARN | 12 | Flags remote modules whose contents are not statically inspectable. Auto-SKIPped when `--plan` is supplied |
| `S-12.x.del` | FAIL | 12 | **Plan-only.** Flags `resource_changes` actions that destroy logging, retention, or monitoring resources (logging config, log-destination buckets/log-groups, SSE/lifecycle configs, metric filters, alarms). Replacements (create+delete) downgrade to WARN. SKIPped without `--plan` |

**Retention thresholds.** `S-12.1.2a` is intentionally WARN-only by default — real estates often satisfy retention via a forwarder (Datadog/Splunk/SIEM, central log-archive account, auto-subscription Lambda) the scanner can't see. When an `aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter` targets the log group, the WARN message says so; otherwise it reminds the reader forwarders are commonly out-of-repo. `S-12.1.2b` uses the same graduated thresholds on the S3 side: 365 = audit-grade, 180 = floor below which Article 72 (post-market monitoring) routinely breaks.

---

## Architecture

A small, layered TypeScript pipeline: a parser that turns `.tf` / `.tf.json` files into a uniform JSON representation (via [`hcl2json`](https://github.com/tmccombs/hcl2json)), a value **resolver** that classifies every expression as `literal`, `address`, or `unresolvable` (with a reason code), and a **two-phase rule engine** — Phase 1 builds a `ScanContext` of the buckets and log groups Bedrock is actually writing to, and Phase 2 rules consume that context. Local modules are walked transparently; remote modules are flagged but never fetched.

For the full pipeline diagram, resolver outcome table, `ScanContext` shape, and guidance for adding rules, see **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## How the scanner handles your code

The hardest part of static compliance scanning isn't matching resource types — it's distinguishing *"this is genuinely missing"* from *"this lives somewhere I can't see."* The scanner tells you which one you're looking at.

| Scenario | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Bedrock + `aws_bedrock_model_invocation_logging_configuration` in the same tree, ≥ 1 modality enabled (or all modality toggles unset, which is AWS's enable-all default) | `S-12.1.1: PASS` |
| Logging resource exists but every `*_data_delivery_enabled = false` | `S-12.1.1: FAIL` (no events will be written) |
| Bedrock used, no logging config in scanned files | `INCONCLUSIVE` by default; `FAIL` under `--strict-account-logging` |
| Bedrock log group with `retention_in_days = 7` + `aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter` to Datadog/Splunk | `S-12.1.2a: WARN` (forwarder-aware remediation) |
| Indirect Bedrock signals only (IAM grants for `bedrock:*`, VPC endpoint to `bedrock-runtime`, `aws_bedrock_foundation_model` data source) | Always `INCONCLUSIVE` — the deploying resource may live in another stack |
| Local modules (`source = "./modules/..."`) | Scanned recursively into the same context |
| Remote modules (registry/git/http/bitbucket) — no plan | Flagged via `S-12.x.5`; `S-12.1.1` emits `INCONCLUSIVE` rather than misleading `SKIP` if Bedrock might live inside |
| Remote modules — with `--plan` | Resources visible via `planned_values.child_modules[]`; rules evaluate them directly, `S-12.x.5` auto-SKIPs |
| `.tf.json` (cdktf, Terragrunt) | Parsed alongside `.tf` — same internal representation |

**Bedrock Guardrails — Agent-attached vs SDK runtime.**

- `S-9.x.1` covers Agent attachment via `guardrail_configuration` on `aws_bedrockagent_agent`. It verifies `guardrail_identifier` is non-empty and `guardrail_version` is numbered (not `"DRAFT"`).
- `S-9.x.2` is a weaker presence check — "is *any* guardrail declared anywhere?" — that WARNs rather than FAILs, since guardrails commonly live in a separate security stack.
- Neither rule verifies SDK-level `guardrailIdentifier` parameters on `InvokeModel`/`Converse`. That's application code, not IaC, and is called out in both rules' remediation messages so a passing `S-9.x.1` is never read as covering SDK-driven workloads.

**Variables, locals, and data sources** are resolved when possible. The resolver returns one of three outcomes:

| Expression | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `"literal-bucket"` | Used directly |
| `var.bucket_name` with `default = "x"` | Resolved to `"x"` |
| `var.bucket_name` with no default | INCONCLUSIVE (`var-no-default`) |
| `local.bucket = "x"` | Resolved to `"x"` |
| `aws_s3_bucket.logs.id` | Resolved to that bucket's `bucket` attribute, if scanned |
| `data.aws_ssm_parameter.X.value` | INCONCLUSIVE (`data-source-ssm`) |
| `module.X.output_name` | INCONCLUSIVE (`module-output`) |
| `prefix-${var.X}` | INCONCLUSIVE (`complex-interpolation`) |

Variable resolution is **module-scoped** — a `var.foo` in `./modules/bedrock_logging/main.tf` only resolves against `variable` blocks in that same directory.

The decision to emit INCONCLUSIVE vs FAIL is driven **only** by what is statically present — no naming-convention heuristics. A `data.terraform_remote_state.<anything>` reference, a module called `bedrock_logging`, or an input key like `log_bucket` does **not** influence the verdict, because any naming-based suppression is a false positive waiting to happen. If logging really lives in another stack, scan that stack too — or accept the default `INCONCLUSIVE`.

## How to use

```bash
infrarails <directory> [options]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-f, --format <format>` | `terminal` | `terminal`, `json`, `sarif`, `html`, or `pdf`. `pdf` is binary and **requires `-o`**. Unknown values exit `2`. |
| `-o, --output <file>` | stdout | Write report to a file. Required for `--format pdf`. When `html`/`json`/`sarif` is used without `-o` and stdout is a TTY, prints a tip to stderr (silent when piped, so scripts/CI are unaffected). |
| `--no-strict` | strict on | Treat `INCONCLUSIVE` as non-blocking. By default INCONCLUSIVE blocks the exit code like FAIL — for a compliance tool, "we couldn't verify" should not silently pass a CI gate. |
| `--strict-account-logging` | off | Asserts the scanned tree is the entire estate. Three escalations: (1) missing logging config → `FAIL`; (2) `S-12.1.2a` retention findings → `FAIL` when no subscription filter is found; (3) with `--plan`, user-fixable INCONCLUSIVEs → `FAIL` (see [Audit-grade scan with `--plan`](#audit-grade-scan-with---plan)). |
| `--plan <file>` | — | Path to Terraform plan JSON (`terraform show -json tfplan.bin`). Resolves expressions and exposes resources inside remote modules. **Plan files contain resolved variable values — treat as ephemeral.** Full workflow, caveats, and `-target` warning: see [Audit-grade scan with `--plan`](#audit-grade-scan-with---plan). |
| `--version`, `-h` | — | Version / help |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | No blocking findings |
| `1` | One or more blocking findings (FAIL, WARN; plus INCONCLUSIVE in strict mode) |
| `2` | Tool error — invalid directory, `hcl2json` not found, etc. |

### Examples

```bash
infrarails ./infra/                                   # human-readable terminal output
infrarails ./infra/ --format html  -o report.html     # collapsible HTML report
infrarails ./infra/ --format pdf   -o report.pdf      # paginated PDF (best for sharing)
infrarails ./infra/ --format json  -o report.json     # machine-readable
infrarails ./infra/ --format sarif -o infrarails.sarif # SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub Code Scanning
infrarails ./infra/ --no-strict                       # INCONCLUSIVE won't block CI
infrarails ./infra/ --strict-account-logging          # tightest verdict (single-repo estate)
```

## Prerequisites

`infrarails` needs two things on `PATH`:

| Dep | Why | Min version |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js + npm** | Runtime | Node 18+ (CLI) / Node 20.x, 22.x, or 24+ (tests — vitest 4.x requirement) |
| **[`hcl2json`](https://github.com/tmccombs/hcl2json)** | Converts HCL → JSON | any recent release |

The CLI invokes `hcl2json` via `child_process.spawnSync` over stdin (no shell), so behaviour is identical across macOS, Linux, and native Windows.

```bash
# macOS
brew install node hcl2json

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/hcl2json https://github.com/tmccombs/hcl2json/releases/latest/download/hcl2json_linux_amd64
sudo install -m 0755 /tmp/hcl2json /usr/local/bin/hcl2json
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser   # required for npm.ps1 on fresh installs
$dest = "$env:USERPROFILE\bin"; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dest | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/tmccombs/hcl2json/releases/latest/download/hcl2json_windows_amd64.exe" -OutFile "$dest\hcl2json.exe"
$env:Path = "$dest;$env:Path"   # or add permanently via System Properties
```

> **If `Set-ExecutionPolicy` fails** with a Group Policy error (common on managed machines), run a single command via `cmd /c npm ...` or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "..."`. WSL is also fine — install via the Linux instructions inside the WSL shell, and keep your Terraform tree in the WSL filesystem (`~/...`) rather than `/mnt/c/...` for performance.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g infrarails                       # from npm (recommended)
npm update  -g infrarails                       # upgrade
npm uninstall -g infrarails                     # remove
```

Or from source if you want to track `main` or modify rules locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/policyrails/infrarails.git
cd infrarails
npm install && npm run build && npm link        # exposes the local build as `infrarails`
```

After cloning, `git pull && npm run build` is enough to pick up upstream changes — no re-link needed. `npm unlink -g infrarails` removes it.

---

## Output formats

| Format | Notes |
|---|---|
| `terminal` (default) | Colour-coded, grouped by status, with framework cross-references per finding |
| `html` | Self-contained single-file report. Collapsible sections (FAIL/WARN/INCONCLUSIVE expanded; PASS/SKIP collapsed), coloured EU/NIST/ISO framework pills with tooltips, print-friendly CSS |
| `pdf` | Paginated, server-side via [`pdfkit`](https://pdfkit.org/) — no headless Chromium. Layout mirrors HTML. **Recommended for sharing with auditors** and over channels where HTML is awkward. On Windows, PDF avoids the SmartScreen warning that HTML opened from UNC paths (`\\wsl.localhost\...`) triggers |
| `json` | Machine-readable. Each finding includes `ruleId`, `status`, `description`, `remediation`, and `regulatoryReference` / `nistReference` / `isoReference` |
| `sarif` | SARIF 2.1.0 — OASIS standard consumed by GitHub Code Scanning, Azure DevOps, GitLab, and the VS Code SARIF Viewer (see [SARIF and GitHub Code Scanning](#sarif-and-github-code-scanning)) |

### Sample reports

Page 1 of two real scans, generated with `--format pdf`:

| `sample-chat-bedrock` (small, focused stack) | `infrastructure` (large multi-stack estate) |

## CI integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Compliance scan
  run: |
    npm install -g infrarails
    infrarails ./infra/ --format json   -o compliance-report.json
    infrarails ./infra/ --format html   -o report.html

- name: Upload artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: compliance-report
    path: |
      compliance-report.json
      report.html
```

### SARIF and GitHub Code Scanning

`--format sarif` emits a [SARIF 2.1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) document. Uploading it via `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` surfaces findings as PR annotations and in the repo's **Security → Code scanning** tab.

```yaml
- name: Compliance scan (SARIF)
  run: |
    npm install -g infrarails
    infrarails ./infra/ --format sarif -o infrarails.sarif
  continue-on-error: true   # let the upload step run even on findings

- name: Upload SARIF
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: infrarails.sarif
    category: infrarails
```

| infrarails status | SARIF `level` | SARIF `kind` | Shown in Code Scanning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FAIL` | `error` | `fail` | Yes (error alert) |
| `WARN` | `warning` | `fail` | Yes (warning alert) |
| `INCONCLUSIVE` | `warning` | `review` | Yes (needs human verification) |
| `PASS` | `none` | `pass` | No (kept for audit-trail tooling) |
| `SKIP` | `none` | `notApplicable` | No |

Each result carries `partialFingerprints` so GitHub correlates the same finding across re-runs even when line numbers shift, plus a `properties` bag with the parsed `frameworks` array, the raw framework reference strings, and the `unresolvedReason` for INCONCLUSIVE findings. The tool driver advertises the full rule catalogue so SARIF consumers have a stable list of what infrarails can detect.

### GitLab CI

```yaml
compliance:
  stage: validate
  script:
    - npm install -g infrarails
    - infrarails ./infra/ --format json -o compliance-report.json
    - infrarails ./infra/ --format html -o report.html
  artifacts:
    paths: [compliance-report.json, report.html]
```

### Audit-grade scan with `--plan`

A Terraform plan resolves expressions the static scanner can't (variables without defaults, data sources, module outputs) and exposes resources inside remote modules. Pair it with `--strict-account-logging` for the tightest verdict.

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan.bin
terraform show -json tfplan.bin > plan.json
infrarails ./infra --plan plan.json --strict-account-logging
rm plan.json   # contains resolved variable values — treat as ephemeral
```

**What `--strict-account-logging` does.** It asserts "this scanned tree is the entire infra estate," turning the indirect `S-12.1.1` INCONCLUSIVE and the forwarder-less `S-12.1.2a` WARN into hard FAILs. With `--plan` it also escalates user-fixable INCONCLUSIVEs to FAIL:

| Unresolved reason | Strict+plan behaviour |
|---|---|
| `var-no-default`, `local-not-literal`, `data-source-*`, `module-output`, `complex-interpolation`, `plan-deferred-data-source`, `plan-remote-state-unreachable` | **Escalate to FAIL** — user can fix the expression or rerun the plan |
| `plan-known-after-apply` (AWS auto-generated, e.g. bucket name) | Stay INCONCLUSIVE — Terraform itself cannot know at plan time |
| `plan-sensitive-redacted` (`terraform show -json` redacts sensitive values) | Stay INCONCLUSIVE — flipping to FAIL would punish correct secret handling |

`S-12.1.2a` strictness is independent: retention findings escalate to FAIL only when no CloudWatch subscription filter is found. A detected forwarder keeps the result at WARN.

**Refresh-only / no-change plans.** Plans with no create/update/delete actions are accepted but emit a stderr note — deletion-safety analysis (`S-12.x.del`) is skipped because there are no destroys to evaluate.

> **Do not use `-target` (or `-replace`) plans for audit-grade scans.** Terraform narrows both `planned_values` and `resource_changes` to the targeted closure, and the scanner **cannot auto-detect** this — the JSON looks identical to a full plan. Resources outside the targeted set silently fall back to HCL-only scanning, so unresolved expressions in those resources will be reported as `INCONCLUSIVE` with no indication a full plan would have resolved them. Always generate the plan with an unscoped `terraform plan -out=tfplan.bin`, and sanity-check the `Info: plan overlay loaded (N resources, ...)` line on stderr against the resource count you expect.

### Recommendation for CI gates

- **Strict mode (default)** — `INCONCLUSIVE` blocks the build. Best for high-assurance environments.
- **`--no-strict`** — only `FAIL`/`WARN` block. Best when you have a known cross-stack logging topology a single-repo scan cannot reach.
- **Audit-grade** — add `--plan` and `--strict-account-logging` (see [above](#audit-grade-scan-with---plan)).

## Roadmap

| Sprint | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **1A** | Done | Terraform HCL/JSON scanning — 9 rules (Article 9 + Article 12), value resolver, two-phase engine, cross-stack/local-module detection, NIST + ISO cross-references, terminal/JSON/HTML/PDF outputs |
| **1B** | Done | `--plan` mode: consume `terraform show -json` output to resolve expressions, scan inside remote modules, and detect destructive changes via `S-12.x.del`. Includes the strict-mode INCONCLUSIVE → FAIL escalator |
| **1C** | Planned | CloudFormation support via a shared IR (design doc: [docs/cloudformation-support-design.md](docs/cloudformation-support-design.md)); CDK support; additional Bedrock Agent guardrail rules |

## Disclaimer

This report reflects the findings of an automated static analysis of your AWS AI infrastructure configuration against selected controls from the **EU AI Act**, **NIST AI RMF**, and **ISO/IEC 42001**. A passing result indicates that the scanned Terraform configuration satisfies the specific infrastructure-layer prerequisite checked — it does not constitute compliance with any of these frameworks, nor does it substitute for a formal audit, certification, or conformity assessment conducted by an accredited body.

Compliance with the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and ISO/IEC 42001 requires organisational, procedural, and governance measures outside the scope of infrastructure scanning. Treat this report as a **pre-audit readiness input**, not an attestation of conformance.
